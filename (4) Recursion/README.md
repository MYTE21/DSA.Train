# Recursion

> Google: Did you mean: recursion.
> Programmers: No! We meant: recursion.

🔃 **Recursion** is not any data structure or any algorithm. But, it is important as it is used in many data structures and algorithms. It is also used in `backtracking`.

We already know that one function can be called from another function. But **recursion** is the function that calls itself.:

```python
# Simplest Recursion function
def my_func():
    my_func()
```

⁉️ **Now the question remains, why we use the `recursion`? What is the benefit of using ?:**

&nbsp; ▷ ➡️ If it helps to find the solution to a problem when we convert the problem into more small problem ,
then we will use recursion.



♨️ **Let's get the concept of this `recursion` with an Example:**

We all know about `factorial`, right? if $n$ is an integer number then the factorial of $n$ will be writen as $n!$. That means, multiplication of all the numbers from 1 to $n$.

$n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

In the same way,

$(n - 1)! = (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$

Now we can write $n!$ as -

$n! = n \times (n - 1)!$

This concludes that, factorial of any number is the multiplication of the factorial of its previous number.

$f(n) = n \times f(n - 1);$ for all $n > 0$

⬆️ This function is called `recursive` function.

Now, the above recursion function will run forever, as we're subtracting 1 from $n$ in every step.
This has to be stopped somewhere. However, we know that the value of $1!$ is 1. We call this our `base condition`.
Every `recursive` function has to have 1 `base condition`.
